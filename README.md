# Duplicate File Finder  
* This program finds duplicate files in a folder and its subfolders. Duplicates are moved to a separate folder. Files are not checked based on filenames. They are checked based on file size and chunks of binary data that the file is composed of.
* The program can be run in a second mode that searches for files of a specified name, and deletes them in the folder and subfolders of a specified directory. For example, it's useful in deleting multiple Thumbs.db files. The User is given a choice of whether the search should be case sensitive or not.
* There is also a planned mode to find image duplicates based on similarity of pixels, even if the images are in different file formats. This is yet to be programmed fully.

    
# To run the program  
Simply run the main file as:  
python3 main.py  
  
# TODO
These are mentioned in the code for now.

# Additional info
* The project was created with LiClipse using Python3.
* The GUI library used is PySimpleGUI.
