# duplicateFileFinder  
This program finds duplicate files in a folder and its subfolders. Duplicates are moved to a separate folder. Files are not checked based on filenames. They are checked based on file size and the first few chunks of data that the file is composed of.  
There is also a mode for checking image file similarity using the image's pixels, even if the images are in different file formats.  
  
# To run the program  
Simply run the main file with:  
python3 main.py
